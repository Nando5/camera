An animated scrolling responsive site for a hypothetical Camera accessory sales promotion.

Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Skrollr.js, Moderniser, Enquire.js, Focuspoint; <br> Duration: 1 day

This project let me play around with Skrollr.js which allows the user to scroll an animation sequence when they visit the site. It is for a hypothetical camera accessory sales promo. I wanted it to be interesting and fun while maintaining a simple elegant feel to it.

Images were downloaded from shutterstock and optimised/edited in Photoshop. I also created the animated svg myself using Illustrator.

In addition the site is responsive and scales down nicely for smaller screens. However for smaller screens or devices without scrolling capabilties i have turned off skrollr. This means the site will change and display differently for those users but still contain the same content. I achieved this with media queries as well as enquire.js which detects the type of screen being used and will enable or disable skrollr accordingly.
